High Priority Tasks to be done:

    1. [DONE] Add mixed beat_division_factors -->   Works fine except for when tempo and time signature change don't
                                                        overlap
                                                    Also, doesn't work if tempo change in the middle of beat
    2. import directly from midi
    5. Create a notebook TUTORIAL!!!

Lower Priority Tasks to be done

    1. does have velocity variations?
    2. does have utiming variations?
    3. is performance?
    4. Split using given time indices or time in seconds or n_bars
    5. split large using smaller windows and overlap --> maybe better to use an external class
    6. Split at tempo change, split and time_sig change, split at meta change
    4. Implement Appending sequences
    7. save score as png
    8. Flatten a number of voices to a single pitch
    9. Remove a Voice
